You will enjoy the warm, chewy texture paired with the sweetness of brown sugar and a hint of cinnamon.\n\n### Classic Oatmeal Cookies\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 1 cup rolled oats\n- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour\n- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n- 1/4 teaspoon salt\n- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n- 1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened\n- 1/4 cup granulated sugar\n- 1/4 cup packed brown sugar\n- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract\n- 1 large egg\n- 1/4 cup raisins or chocolate chips (optional)\n\n#### Instructions:\n\n1. **Preheat the Oven:**\n   Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup.\n\n2. **Mix Dry Ingredients:**\n   In a medium bowl, combine the rolled oats, flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Stir the ingredients together until well combined. This ensures even distribution of flavors and leavening.\n\n3. **Cream Butter and Sugars:**\n   In a separate large bowl, use a mixer (or a whisk if you prefer) to cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until smooth and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes. \n\n4. **Add Egg and Vanilla:**\n   Beat in the egg and vanilla extract to the butter-sugar mixture until fully blended. The mixture should be creamy and light in color.\n\n5. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:**\n   Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet ingredients. Stir gently with a spatula or wooden spoon until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the cookies tough.\n\n6. **Fold in Add-ins:**\n   If you'd like to add some extra flavor, fold in the raisins or chocolate chips at this stage.\n\n7. **Scoop the Dough:**\n   Using a tablespoon or cookie scoop, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches of space between each cookie to allow for spreading.\n\n8. **Bake:**\n   Bake in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown but the centers still look slightly soft. They will continue to firm up as they cool.\n\n9. **Cool:**\n   Once baked, remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.\n\n10. **Enjoy:**\n   Serve your warm oatmeal cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!\n\nThese oatmeal cookies are perfect for sharing or enjoying as a hearty snack. They have a lovely chewy texture and a comforting flavor.
