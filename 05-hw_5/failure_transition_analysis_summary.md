# Recipe Bot Agent Failure Transition Analysis Summary

## Executive Summary

Analysis of 135 agent interactions revealed an **8.1% failure rate** (11 failures) with failures concentrated in two key transition patterns. The Recipe Bot agent operates through a 5-step pipeline: ParseRequest → RewriteQuery → PlanToolCalls → GetRecipes → DeliverResponse.

## Key Findings

### Most Common Failure Transitions

1. **PlanToolCalls → GetRecipes (4 occurrences, 36.4% of failures)**

   - **Description**: Agent successfully plans tool calls but fails during recipe retrieval
   - **Impact**: Users experience failed recipe lookups after successful query processing
   - **Root Cause**: Issues in the `find_matching_recipes` step, likely related to:
     - BM25 retrieval failures
     - Recipe database connectivity issues
     - Malformed search queries passed to retrieval system

2. **DeliverResponse → DeliverResponse (7 occurrences, 63.6% of failures)**
   - **Description**: Agent fails at the final response delivery stage
   - **Impact**: Users may receive incomplete or low-quality responses
   - **Root Cause**: Issues in final response generation, likely related to:
     - LLM response quality scoring failures (scores < 1.0)
     - Content formatting issues
     - Response completeness validation failures

### Agent Step Success Rates

Based on the transition analysis:

- **ParseRequest**: No direct failures identified
- **RewriteQuery**: High success rate (no failures observed as last success step)
- **PlanToolCalls**: 36.4% of failures occur after this step
- **GetRecipes**: Primary bottleneck with retrieval failures
- **DeliverResponse**: 63.6% of failures occur at final stage

## Technical Analysis

### Agent Architecture Review

The Recipe Bot uses a sophisticated multi-step architecture:

1. **Query Rewrite Agent**: LLM-powered query optimization for BM25 retrieval
2. **Retrieval System**: BM25-based recipe matching with processed recipe database
3. **Tool Calling Framework**: OpenAI-compatible function calling for recipe lookups
4. **Online Scoring**: Real-time evaluation of agent steps and final responses

### Failure Detection Mechanism

Failures are identified through:

- **Error conditions**: Explicit exceptions during step execution
- **Score-based detection**: Steps with scores < 1.0 are marked as failures
- **Transition tracking**: Last successful step before first failure is recorded

## Detailed Failure Patterns

### Recipe Retrieval Failures (PlanToolCalls → GetRecipes)

**Frequency**: 4/11 failures (36.4%)

**Potential Causes**:

- Query rewrite agent producing malformed search terms
- BM25 index corruption or unavailability
- Recipe database connectivity issues
- Insufficient matching recipes for niche queries

**Evidence from Code**:

```python
@bt.traced
def find_matching_recipes(query: str) -> str:
    recipes = retriever.retrieve_bm25(query, 3)
    bt.current_span().log(metadata={"agent_step": "find_matching_recipes"})
    return _format_recipes_for_llm(recipes)
```

### Response Generation Failures (DeliverResponse → DeliverResponse)

**Frequency**: 7/11 failures (63.6%)

**Potential Causes**:

- LLM response quality below threshold
- Incomplete recipe formatting
- Missing required recipe components (ingredients, steps, nutrition)
- Online scorer detecting poor response quality

## Recommendations for Improvement

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Enhance Recipe Retrieval Robustness**

   - Add fallback retrieval strategies when BM25 returns insufficient results
   - Implement query expansion for zero-result scenarios
   - Add retry logic for retrieval failures
   - Monitor BM25 index health and performance

2. **Strengthen Response Quality Control**
   - Implement response validation before delivery
   - Add structured output formatting with required fields
   - Create fallback response templates for edge cases
   - Review and adjust scoring thresholds for response quality

### Medium-Term Improvements

3. **Query Rewrite Enhancement**

   - Add validation for rewritten queries before retrieval
   - Implement query rewrite quality scoring
   - Add fallback to original query if rewrite produces poor results
   - Monitor query rewrite effectiveness metrics

4. **Comprehensive Error Handling**

   - Add graceful degradation for each agent step
   - Implement user-friendly error messages
   - Create retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
   - Add circuit breaker patterns for external dependencies

5. **Enhanced Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Set up real-time monitoring for failure rate increases
   - Create alerts for specific failure pattern spikes
   - Implement automated health checks for critical components
   - Add detailed logging for failure root cause analysis

### Long-Term Strategic Improvements

6. **Agent Architecture Evolution**
   - Consider implementing parallel retrieval strategies
   - Add human-in-the-loop validation for edge cases
   - Implement adaptive scoring thresholds based on performance
   - Design A/B testing framework for agent improvements

## Success Metrics to Monitor

- **Overall failure rate**: Currently 8.1%, target < 5%
- **Recipe retrieval success rate**: Monitor PlanToolCalls → GetRecipes transition
- **Response quality scores**: Track distribution of final response scores
- **End-to-end latency**: Ensure improvements don't impact performance
- **User satisfaction**: Implement user feedback collection for response quality

## Conclusion

The Recipe Bot agent demonstrates strong overall performance with a low 8.1% failure rate. However, the concentration of failures in recipe retrieval and response generation stages presents clear opportunities for improvement. Implementing the recommended enhancements, particularly around retrieval robustness and response quality control, should significantly reduce failure rates and improve user experience.

The failure transition heatmap provides a powerful tool for ongoing monitoring and will help track the effectiveness of implemented improvements over time.
