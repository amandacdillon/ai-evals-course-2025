Preheat your grill to high heat (about 450\u00b0F - 500\u00b0F).\n3. Pat the steaks dry with a paper towel and brush both sides lightly with olive oil.\n4.

Use a meat thermometer for precision; aim for 130\u00b0F for medium-rare, and 140\u00b0F for medium.\n8. Once done, remove the steaks from the grill and let them rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing.

Carefully place the tuna steaks in the skillet and sear for about 1-2 minutes on each side, depending on your preferred doneness (1 minute for rare, 2 minutes for medium-rare).\n5. Remove the tuna from the skillet and let it rest for a minute. Slice against the grain into thick pieces.\n6. Serve with soy sauce and optional wasabi or spicy mayo on the side.\n\n### Tips\n* For added flavor, marinate the tuna in a mix of soy sauce and ginger for 15 minutes before searing.\n* Ensure you have a very hot skillet for an optimal sear.\n\n---\n\n## Simple Ahi Tuna Poke Bowl\n\nA simple cooked ahi tuna dish, made into a delightful poke bowl, combining fresh ingredients and flavors for a nutritious meal prep option.\n\n### Ingredients\n* 6 oz ahi tuna steak, thawed\n* 1/2 cup cooked brown rice or quinoa\n* 1/4 cup diced cucumber\n* 1/4 cup edamame (shelled)\n* 1/4 cup diced avocado\n* 1 tbsp soy sauce\n* 1 tsp sesame oil\n* 1 tsp rice vinegar\n* 1/2 tsp grated ginger\n* 1 green onion, sliced (for garnish)\n* Seaweed flakes (optional, for garnish)\n\n### Instructions\n1.

Cook on low for 8 hours or on high for 4 hours until the pork is tender and easily shreds.\n4. **Shred the Meat**: Remove the pork from the slow cooker and shred using two forks.
