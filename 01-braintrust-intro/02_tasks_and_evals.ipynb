      "=== FINAL ANSWER ===\n",
      "I understand your concern about your doubled water bill! Let me help explain some potential causes based on Encinitas water billing information.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, it's important to note that the District bills potable (drinking) water customers on a bi-monthly basis (every two months) and are due and payable upon presentation. This means you might be seeing charges for two months of usage at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some common reasons why your water bill might have doubled:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Billing Cycle:** Since Encinitas uses bi-monthly billing, if you're comparing to a previous monthly statement or there was a timing difference, this could explain the increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Leak Detection:** The search results mention leak detection services, which suggests this is a common issue. Undetected leaks can significantly increase water usage and costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Seasonal Usage:** Increased outdoor watering, especially during warmer months, can substantially raise your bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Rate Changes:** There may have been recent rate adjustments that affected your charges.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sewer Charges:** The charge is calculated based upon a percentage of water use at the property, so if your water usage increased, your sewer charges would also increase proportionally.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What you can do:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Dispute Process:** If you think your bill is incorrect or to dispute any services or charges on a bill, you must contact our office in writing with the nature of your concern within five days of receipt of your bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Payment Assistance:** If you are having difficulty paying your water bill you may be eligible to request a payment arrangement.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Contact Information:**\n",
      "- San Dieguito Water District: 160 Calle Magdalena Encinitas, CA 92024\n",
      "- For after-hours emergencies: (760) 633-2922\n",
      "\n",
      "I recommend contacting the San Dieguito Water District directly to review your specific bill and usage history. They can help identify the exact cause of the increase and provide detailed explanations of all charges.\n",
